# CSCI-245---PHP-Fibonacci-
Simple PHP Program that outputs the first 4 numbers in the fibonacci sequence using an array.

This project will give you chance to further understand PHP and basic syntax of PHP. You are required to realize a Fibonacci Number Calculator, which can calculate the first 20 Fibonacci numbers, given that the first two Fibonacci numbers are both 1. 
About Fibonacci numbers:
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence: 
 
By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation
 
 Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

with seed values
  
  F1 = 1 and F2 = 2
